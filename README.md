This project focuses on intelligent grading of advanced calculus homework and learning from one mistake to avoid others. Through multi-module collaboration, it achieves multi-format input of homework, intelligent identification of questions, automatic grading, and analysis of knowledge points related to incorrect questions. Subsequently, it accurately recommends similar questions, helping students to specifically strengthen their weak points in advanced calculus and improve learning efficiency.
